            <h3><b>About the workshop</b></h3>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The NYC Cybersecurity Day workshop is organized by New York University (NYU) in collaboration with the Google Cyber NYC Institutional Research Program, featuring participation from universities in the NYC area, including CUNY, Columbia, Cornell, and NYU. Our goal is to unite experts from the NYC region to discuss the future of cybersecurity. This workshop will be the first workshop of the series. The workshop would be a half-day event  taking place at NYU Brooklyn's hub for technology and art, bringing together a distinguished group of leading scholars and experts specializing in various aspects of human elements in cybersecurity. Discussions will delve into vital topics such as privacy, network management, ethics in AI systems, legal considerations, and more.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The workshop's agenda includes four invited talks, with each panelist delivering a short, informal, 30-minute presentation, followed by engaging discussions among participants. Attendees will have the opportunities to actively participate in these discussions and share their valuable insights. For a comprehensive schedule and further details regarding the workshop's speakers and participants, please refer to the information provided below.</p>
